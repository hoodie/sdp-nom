# SDP-rs

This is an experimental nom based SDP parser.
It can parse and reserialize and is currently optimized for a very small wasm footprint (hence the use of [ufmt](https://docs.rs/ufmt)).
There are caveats, this is by far nothing that can be used for any particular usecase.

If you are interested please contact me.
